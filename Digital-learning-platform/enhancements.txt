### Embedding Strategy

This system uses **OpenAI's embedding API** instead of downloading local models like sentence-transformers. This approach offers several advantages:

- ✅ **No local model downloads** - Reduces storage requirements and setup complexity
- ✅ **Always up-to-date** - Access to the latest embedding models without manual updates  
- ✅ **Better performance** - OpenAI's embeddings are typically more accurate than local alternatives
- ✅ **Scalability** - No memory constraints from loading large embedding models locally
- ✅ **Consistency** - Same embeddings across different deployment environments

### Performance Optimization

- Use GPU-enabled embeddings for faster processing
- Implement caching for frequently accessed documents
- Batch process multiple PDFs for efficiency

## Production Deployment

### Security Considerations

- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Set up CORS policies appropriately
- Monitor API usage and rate limiting

### Scaling

- Use container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Implement horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Consider async processing for large documents
- Use external vector databases for production scale
